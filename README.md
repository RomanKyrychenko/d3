Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) data for Perth and Kinross, Scotland.

Data Zones and Intermediate Zones are two new, small-area statistical geographies introduced by Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) to build on the well-established postcode and census geographies. Data Zones have a population of between 500 and 1,000 household residents. Intermediate Zones are aggregations of data zones within local authorities and contain between 2,500 and 6,000 people. Data Zones and Intermediate Zones are now the key geographies for disseminating government statistics and for supporting policy making in Scotland.
